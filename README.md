## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1)Snapchat
- Stories are automically saved in an archive without manually doing it
- It shouldn't show a notification when someone deletes a message
2)Score
- Better live scoring and stat updates during games
- A feature where one has the option to watch the game live
3)Instagram
- Able to access deleted messages
- An archive for live videos that doesn't delete after only 30 days

- An app I would like to build is a stat projection app for your favorite player on any sports team. The app would basically take single game stats from any player, and display the stats that they're on pace to achieving. The app will also include live scoring updates, injury reports, news, and multiple ways to watch any live sport games.
## Notes
